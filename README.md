Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, video, or in real-time.

Face Tracking:-
Simple and realtime face tracking in a video sequence.

Face Alignment:-
Face alignment is the task of identifying the geometric structure of faces in digital images, and attempting to obtain a canonical alignment of the face based on translation, scale, and rotation.
Using Face Alignment we can get higher accuracy from our face recognition. As Face Alignment is like data normalization.

Human Activity Recognition:-
Human activity recognition model can recognize over 400 activities with 78.4-94.5% accuracy.
